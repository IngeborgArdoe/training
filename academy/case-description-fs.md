# Facility Management
**SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR:** *The instructor will start off by giving you a brief introduction to the topic, but this page will serve as a reference if you wish to lookup some information during the course.*


Throughout the course material, we will be working within a Property Management environment. We have a base solution in Genus, and will expand functionality and user interfaces to provide Facility Services to property tenants. Facility services typically provide tools to support property functionality, safety and infrastructure. It often includes, but is not limited to, fire safety, cleaning services, operating cafeterias, custodial services and servicing property infrastructure.

The course environment provides a web application interface providing property tenants an overview of ongoing maintenance and services, and a "backroom" application for property management to ensure handling of infrastructure tasks etc.


## Starting Point

The most important

* Company
  Service Providers; typically service companies providing yearly or on-demand services, usually linked to agreements.
  Service Subsribers; typically tenants
* Agreement
* Component
* Task
* Property

## Expansion
We want to improve the solution, by allowing tenants to submit concerns about the properties through their web applications. These concerns can be followed up though tasks, if action is required from the property manager.

Concerns are reported by service subscribers, or even other representatives of the tenants, and connected to a location. Eventually, we would like to enable uploading photos and support communication between the concern reporter and the property management.
