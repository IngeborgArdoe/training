# Data Model in Genus

Now that you're familiar with the Genus Clients, we're going to have a look at the Data Model.

When we talk about models in Genus, we are talking about the description – or model - of the real world, or real business case, that we build in Genus through your application. While the term “model” is often used to describe a simplification of reality, the Genus model is a literal translation or description of your application.  In other words; “The model is the Application”.
This application model, or description, can be split into three main parts:







These three parts – the data model, the business and application logic, and user interfaces - sum up to the Genus Application Model – the model you create in Genus Studio to meet your business needs.

Because the Business Logic is applied to, or utilizes, some knowledge or stores data relating to the model and user interfaces also are dependent on data to display - we will start looking at our Data Model.
