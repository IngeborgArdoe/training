# Repetition and documents

In the following section, we will add two very different types of document handling in our solution: uploading a photo, and generating a document.

## Uploading Photo to Concerns
We will add the Object Class Properties and actions required to support photo uploading in the Concern view. 


## Generating Documents with Mail Merge
Genus supports the 3rd party module "Mail Merge", provided by Microsoft to generate documents with dynamic input fields.
