##Exercise 1.1.2 Genus Microsoft Desktop Client

While this course focuses heavily on Genus' Web interfaces, some "backroom" functionality is showcased in the Desktop Client.
Using the "Genus Desktop"-shortcut on the Home page of the edu-user, log into the Desktop functionality.

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the solution. Users logging into this solution, will most likely be administration from the Property Management's company, keeping track of all customers (subscribers) and providers (companies hired to perform maintenance etc on properties)


Navigate to the Administration. Take a look at Users and General Codes.

1. **Providers**
The Provider Pane provides an overview of Companies, subscribers and providers. The "Provider" table is merely a filtered version of the "Companies" table, but provides a more specialized context to work in. You can also keep track of agreements - signed or drafted in this navigation section. These agreements usually pertains to maintenance or service agreements for specific services or properties. In the Facility Management app, the tenant can view the agreements pertaining to their lease and physical components.

2. **Properties**
The Properties Pane is used to keep track of all properties the Property Manager has registered in its system - these can be properties the Property Manager owns and leases out today, or prospective properties.

3. **Administration**
The Administration Pane is often used to manage dynamic code domains and user access. Most of the available code domains here are location based.
