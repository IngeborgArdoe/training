# Genus' IDE/Developer Tool
**SESSION BY INSTRUCTOR:** *The instructor will start off by giving you a brief introduction to the topic. The session will include a review of Genus Studio's sections and functionality.*



Genus Studio is our IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. This is where we create and manage all parts of the application stack, whether it's the application model, user interfaces, business logic, security policies, deployments and so much more. Access to Genus Studio is limited to superusers who develop applications, services or business logic in Genus.


## User Interaction



###Web and Desktop
The Web section is where you define your web apps and modules, containing web user interfaces and actions.

In turn, the Desktop section is where you define the navigation meny and user interfaces for the Windows Desktop solution.


### Actions
The Actions section is where global actions are defined - actions you create here can be references in the User Interactions (Web and Desktop applications) and Application services (Agents and REST services).


## Application Services

### Agents
Agents are scheduled actions, allowing for automated running of actions.

### Web/REST Services
Genus can expose Web/REST Service endpoints to other systems.

## Security
Throughout Genus, we apply various security mechanisms. These rely on the settings defined in the Security section. Here, you define identiy providers, manage users and create security groups used to provide correct access to apps and data.


## Data Structure
### Object Class/Data Model


### XML Schemas

### Rules
Rules are actions that are triggered by data-based event, such as; after a main Task status is set completed, mark sub-tasks completed as well.


## Administration
