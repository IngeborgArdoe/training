# 2.2 Defining Object Class in Genus from Database table



## 2.2.1 Build object class "Concern" in Studio.

Now that our database table is defined, we still need to "update" the Concern from Draft to Object Class in Genus. To do this, we will follow an import Wizard and customize settings to our Object Class "Concern" and eventually all its properties.

*Guidance: Navigate to Object Classes in Studio (left pane) and right-click -> New -> Object Domain. Go through the wizard, following the directions below.*

1. **Data Provider** Select the database from which the table will be read (it will be set by default if there is only one database, but an application in Genus might have tables in several databases).
2. **Action** Stick with the default "Create a new Object Class"-action. Select the table you will be modeling. This list of tables available to model in Genus is collected from the database, and you will find your new database table "Concern" here. You have the opportunity to override the object's name shown in Genus (e.g. if the table has a technical name).
3. **Table columns**: Choose which columns you want to model. By default, all of them are selected. As we've designed the database table ourselves, we do want to import all columns in this case. Sometimes, not all columns are needed or you are modelling object in Genus based on existing database tables that are designed with a different or wider use case than you need.
4. **Primary key**: Select property Concern ID» and check the «generate identifier automatically». The latter allows Genus to handle uniqueness and the creation of primary keys.
5. **Property definitions**: Double-click on each row/property to verify, and change if needed, the data type and data interpretation, as well as the name. **It is important that Data interpretation is changed wherever needed, as this affects the model interpretation and cannot be altered without re-adding the property again later.** For instance, the field **«Created By»** is supposed to be a reference to the object «Person». This interpretation will affect how the property is treated throughout the entire solution, and will provide the opportunity to connect the property to user in session. Genus will not be able to figure this out unless you specify the interpretation yourself. Double-click on the row and change the data interpretation to "Person" (when you do this, the Display name is also changed to "Person"". Rename it "Created By" instead). Repeat the process for all properties that are bolded in the properties list above (**Modified By** (interpretation "Person"), **State** (interpretation “Object State”), **Company** (interpretation «Company»), **Property** (interpretation "Property"), **Block** (interpretation "Block"), **Floor** (interpretation "Floor"),  **Area** (interpretation "Area"),  **Address** (interpretation Address), **Category** (interpretation "Category"), **CompletionCode** (interpretation "Completion").
6. Step «Naming»: This is the attribute that sets the standard naming of the object. Here you can press Add.. and add Subject. Click on Finish.

If you expand the node «Object Classes» in Studio, you should now see the Contact-object. If you expand Contact further and click on Properties, you will find the list of Object Class Properties belonging to Contact.

The core of your Subject Class is now in place, but there are still some work to be done, especially in terms of property customization.


<!-- **Modified By** (interpretation "Person"), **State** (interpretation “Object State”), **Company** (interpretation «Company»), **Property** (interpretation "Property"), **Address** (interpretation Address), **Category** (interpretation "Category"), **CompletionCode** (interpretation "Completion") -->

# 2.2.3 Concern's Data Properties

Modify the following settings on the Data Properties of Concern (double-click on a Property to view available settings):
1. Subject and Category: Tab «Data Validation», uncheck «Allow blank value». In other words, the fields become mandatory.
2. Created Date:
   1. Tab «Security», check «Read». The field becomes Read Only for the end user.
   2. Tab «Data Calculation»: Set Default = Time Stamp. The value of the field is set to the server's current time when the Contact object is created, and cannot be edited later.
3. Created By: Add the same Security as Created Date, but set default value to «Active User Account Stamp». The value of the field is set to the logged in user that creates the object, and cannot be edited later.
4. Modified Date:
   1. Tab «Security», check «Read».
   2. Tab «Data Calculation», set Formula = Time Stamp. Formulas are updated everytime an object is changed. In other words, Modified Date is updated automatically everytime a user saves a change made on a Contact.
5. Modified By: Same Security as Modified Date, but set Formula = Active User Account Stamp. The value of the field is set to the logged in user everytime a change on a Contact is saved.
<!-- 6. State: Tab «Data Calculation»: Set Default = Active. The state of the Contact is set to Active when it is created. The state can be changed later. Note also that the field is of Data Type int. The state is stored in the database as an integer, but is mapped to the Code Domain in Genus called «Object State», which translates 1 to «Active» and 2 to «Inactive». You will be able to see this by right-clicking the object class «Object State» -> Open -> Data Entries. -->
