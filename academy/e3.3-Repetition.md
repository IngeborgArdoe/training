# 3.3 Repetition


##1 Completed Concerns and Search

1. Create a Completed Concerns view, similar to that of "Ongoing Concerns" from the first View Exercise. Remember to add Completion Code, a field specifically related to completed concerns. Make sure to define row interactions.

2. Add the view to the Concerns-pages group, with the Completed Concerns filter, just not as the default. While the list of open concerns should be relatively short, this list of completed concerns can become quite long. Make sure to enable search, and define a pagination.

3. Save and refresh your web app. Switch from the default view of open concerns to your new view, and test out the search field in the top right corner.
