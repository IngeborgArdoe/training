# Actions and Events
While Actions describe the sequence of effects that are initiated, the Event describes the initiation itself.

## Navigate to Concern Details from Concerns



## Navigate to Task (from Concern)


## Create new Concern

In order to create a new Concern, we need to create a Client Action which creates a new Object and allows for user input. This action will be available within this module.

1. Navigate to Client Actions and add new, name it "Add new Concern". Make sure to add Data Sets. For the Concern Data Set, you want Occurence = One, and Public Interface = In and Out (so the action can both accept pre-defined values where relevand and return the newly created Concern to the context where the action is initiated from).
2. Go to Action Flow. Navigate to "Effects" on the left hand side. Add a Scope Block by double clicking or dragging it into the working area.
Now we want to Create a new Concern which will be edited in the "Concern Details" Form we created initially. The Form is a type of Page, and we add a "Navigate to Page"-effect into the scope. Select Contact Details as the Page. In change handling, you can determine what happens with changes in the current context.

  <li>In the Data Filter-section, click the menu and select "Create Object". Some values here are preset, and some must be given as input. Some can be left blank for the user to fill in and some should have default values which can be edited by the user later. Note that Company is mandatory and blank. As we plan on trigging this Action from the Company form, we will know which Company we want to fill inn here and should send it in as input to the action.</li>

  <li>Navigate to Data Sets and add a Data Source for Company in the Public Interface section. Keep Flow set to In, since we want to receive this information *from* the Company Form. The Company Data Source does not have to be Required. We may want to trigger this action other places within the Company Module where the Company is not pre-defined from context. In these cases, Company value can be set within the "Company Details" Form, along with values such as first name and last name.</li>
  <li> Return to Action Flow. Re-open the "Create Object" data filter. In the menu for the Company field, choose Select Field and choose the Company data source you just added.</li>
</ol>
