# 4.1 Actions and Events
While Actions describe the sequence of effects that are initiated, the Event describes the initiation itself.

## 1. Navigate to Concern Details from Concerns View
Within the Concern Module, navigate to Client Actions. We're going to add a simple navigation Action that takes a single Concern and opens the Concern form.

1. Under Data Sets, add a filtered data set with Concern as the Data Source. The action is used to map a single concern to the form, set Occurrence to One. We want to receive the Concern as input, so "Included in Public Interface" needs to be set to "Yes". Since it's a simple navigation (no data modification, or return to the old context), dataflow "In" is sufficient. Without a Concern provided as input, we cannot navigate to a concern page, so toggle "Required".


2. Head to "Action Flow". Add a "Navigate to Page"-effect. All you need to define here, is the target Page, and the data filtering telling the target which Concern to display. The Target is your Concern form, and because the data set in the action is limited to one concern, you can set data filter to "Transfer All".


Because we've already set the Concern input as "Required" in the data set setup, we do not need any blocks/decisions to determine handling if this value is empty in the Action Flow. We also don't need a scope because the action is simply navigating, not handling any data.


### 2. Use the New Action

We want to use the navigation action, when a user actives (or clicks) a row in our concern views. Head into each Concern View and do the follwing;

1. Navigate to the View. Because we want the action to take place on row-level actions, we need to mark the "table"-level in the control view panel. This can be done in one of two ways; toggle in the control view pane and highlight "Table" or mark a column and click "esc" to move a step up in the hierarchy.

2. On the right-hand side, note the "Interaction"-section. The "On Activate"-setting determines which action is run when a user actives a row (or more) in the table. This is where you want to select your newly created action "Navigate to Concern". Add the data filter Task (0:n).

Save, refresh your browser and test.



## 3. Create new Concern

In order to create a new Concern, we need to create a Client Action which creates a new Object and allows for user input. This action will be available within this module.

1. Navigate to Client Actions and add new, name it "Add new Concern". Make sure to add Data Sets. For the Concern Data Set, you want Occurrence = One, and Public Interface = In and Out (so the action can both accept pre-defined values where relevant and return the newly created Concern to the context where the action is initiated from).
2. Go to Action Flow. Navigate to "Effects" on the left hand side. Add a Scope Block by double clicking or dragging it into the working area.
Now we want to Create a new Concern which will be edited in the "Concern Details" Form we created initially. The Form is a type of Page, and we add a "Navigate to Page"-effect into the scope. Select Contact Details as the Page. In change handling, you can determine what happens with changes in the current context.

  <li>In the Data Filter-section, click the menu and select "New Object". Some values here are preset, and some must be given as input. Some can be left blank for the user to fill in and some should have default values which can be edited by the user later. Note that Subscriber Company is mandatory and blank. As we plan on trigging this Action from the context of a Service Subscriber, we will know which Company we want to fill inn here and should send it in as input to the action. Click "Enter an expression" and add "UserAccountPerson.activeAccount().primaryRepresentativeCompany" as your expression. This is equivalent to the previous checks you've done agains the logged-on user. </li>
</ol>

### Add "Create new Concern" to the Action bar
We want to add the "Create new Concern" to the Concern Views. For each view, do the following;

1. Navigate to View, and toggle control view (Ctrl+Shift+L) or mark a column and "Esc" your way out to the top level. Click the action bar. Add your newly created "Create Concern" to your action bar with an appropriate Icon.
2. Add a "Save Changes" to the action bar as well.



## Action Bar: Extra
The Concern form is normally opened from one of the concern views, and we can assume the user may want to go "Back" to the view they navigated from.

1. Add the default action "Navigate Back" to the Concern and Concern Details form action bar (rename to "Back").
2. Note that the embedded Concern Details in the Concern page, will show its action bar within the Concern page. This leads to doubling up on the "Back"-action, and looks strange in our particular case. In the Concern page, mark the embedded "Concern Details" and toggle "Show Action Bar" off.
