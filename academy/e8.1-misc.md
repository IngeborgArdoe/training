# Exercise 8 - Miscellaneous

This optional exercise contains various extensions to improve you solution. As always, we recommend you to at least read through it.


##1. Create a new landing page for the Task-navigation

Add a Canvas, and make a Kanban-based view of Tasks and/or Concerns.
Add it to the sitemap, either in place of the traditional view, or as an additional Page option.

##2. OPTIONAL: Add an Agent that notifies the Subscriber Company user, of closed Concerns in the last week

*Guidance:*

Add a global agent, that weekly alerts subscriber company representatives of closed concerns:
* _Read Service Subscriber Companies that have any closed Concerns_
* _Enumerate over Companies, and for each, read both company representatives and closed concerns_
* _Create a mail message, that includes a repeating section with Concerns_
* _Test your new agent_
