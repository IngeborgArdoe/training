# Installation of SQL Server Management Studio

To be able to develop/model in Genus Apps, you often have to create new tables and columns in the associated database. For this you will need SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on your computer.

If you for some reason don't want to (or are not allowed to) install SSMS on your computer, you can ask the instructor to run them for you. That being said, we do recommend you to install it on your own computer if possible.

## Download the latest release of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.

After installation, launch SSMS and create a new connection to "genus-education.database.windows.net,1433" with a user name and password provided by your instructor.

*Note: You need to specify your users database in the second tab of the Connect to Server window (hit "Options <<"). Your database is the edu_data{X} database where {X} is your user number.
